HOW TO START THE DASHBOARD
===========================

Open a PowerShell or Command Prompt window and run:

1. Navigate to the project:
   cd C:\Users\JeremySmith\source\repos\Hackathons\hackathon-dashboard

2. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

3. Wait for the message:
   "Local: http://localhost:3000"

4. Open your browser to:
   http://localhost:3000

If you see an error about port 3000 being in use, use a different port:
   npm run dev -- -p 3001

Then open: http://localhost:3001

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

If you get errors:
- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Try: npm install (to reinstall dependencies)
- Check if another app is using port 3000

The build completed successfully, so everything is ready to go!
